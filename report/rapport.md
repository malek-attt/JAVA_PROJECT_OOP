# Shortest Path in Transport Network (Java)

This project implements a transport transport network using graph theory.
Two shortest-path algorithms are implemented:

- Bellman-Ford (initial academic version)
- Dijkstra (refactored and optimized version)

## Structure
- src/bellman : Bellman-Ford implementation
- src/refonte : Refactored version using Dijkstra
- report : Refactoring report

## Academic Context
INSAT – Object-Oriented Programming  
TP3 – 2024/2025
